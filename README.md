# factorial_web_worker

This is a very simple project which helps me understand how web workers work.
In this example I "delegate" to the web worker code which is responsible for factorial calculations.

## Usage

Open the terminal in the place where you want to clone this repo and type

`git clone https://github.com/mb-dir/factorial_web_worker.git .`
